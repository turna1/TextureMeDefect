# Problem
- Synthetic texture generation for industrial applications offers a cost-effective way to visualize complex  textures, such as defect patterns.
 
- Common application includes gaming, art, and design, but industrial defect textures are underexplored.  

- Consumer-grade devices provide portability and real-time industrial applications.  

- Example: Railway personnel can use smartphones to photograph a wheel and generate realistic crack textures on-site.
