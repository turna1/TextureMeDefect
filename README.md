# Download the Dataset: 
[Link to the dataset used for fine-tuning the  LLM for defect texture visual description generation ](https://github.com/turna1/GenAI-For-Goods/blob/DATASETS-TO-BUILD-RAG-LLM-RAILWAY-DEFECT/texture_training_examples.jsonl)

# Code for Synthetic Dataset Generation Pipeline: 
[Yous this notebook with your own OpenAI API key to generate synthetic dataset to Fine-Tune GPT models](https://github.com/turna1/DefectTwin/blob/main/defect_texture__fine_tunellm_with_synthetic_data.ipynb)

# Code for Recreating the tool: 
[Follow this Repo to get the code to test the UI](https://github.com/turna1/DefectTwin/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)

# To watch a live demo please send a request with a subject line- "Requesting demo of TextureMeDefect App" to rferd068@uottawa.ca. We did not make the space public due to the API quota limits.
